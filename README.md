## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This study investigates the origin, structure, and evolutionary consequences of four megabase-scale chromosomal inversions in the Atlantic herring (*Clupea harengus*), which are associated with ecological adaptation to water temperature in North and South Atlantic Ocean. The sequencing data used are - 12 Atlantic herring individuals sequenced with PacBio HiFi, 49 Atlantic herring individuals sequenced with Illumina short-read, 30 Pacific herring individuals sequenced with Illumina short-read, and one European sprat sequenced with PacBio HiFi.

We characterize inversions on:
- **Chromosome 6 (~7.8 Mb)**
- **Chromosome 12 (~2.7 Mb)**
- **Chromosome 17 (~8.3 Mb)**
- **Chromosome 23 (~4.6 Mb)**

### Key findings:
- Inversions are originated via **ectopic recombination** between inverted duplications flanking the inversion.
- Inversion haplotypes are **ancient** (1â€“5 million years old) and are formed **after the split between Atalntic and Pacific herring**.
- Despite recombination suppression, inverted haplotypes show **no significant mutational load**.
